I did not realize that I was meant to document my progress within the GitHub repository. Instead, I documented my progress within each of my sessions and only created this repository afterwards when I realised that it was necessary to submit a project.

That having been said, this project was heavily inspired by the system built by Scott Yu-Jan and was only made to fit my stuff, including my:
- Pens
- Mechanical pencil
- Lead (for my pencil)
- Apple watch straps
- Apple watch portable battery bank
- Mouse weights case
- Crafts knife
- Box which contains blades for my crafts knife
- Rubber
- ID card

PLEASE NOTE: This project is not 100% complete as I have yet to make all of the cutouts for each item. However, I am still happy with what I managed to get done, as I have all of the items modeled and ready.
